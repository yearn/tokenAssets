# Project Hardening Final Completion Report

## Executive Summary

- Consolidated critical auth, upload, and shared helper logic into hardened modules that now run in Vercel's Edge runtime while preserving Node compatibility.
- Refactored the upload experience end-to-end: modular React components, cancellable ERC-20 lookups, deterministic FormData builders, and a fortified API that validates inputs before opening GitHub PRs.
- Upgraded developer tooling by migrating to Biome for lint/format, expanding Vitest coverage, and documenting the workflow so contributors can confidently validate changes.
- Instrumented and stabilized the GitHub OAuth pipeline with structured logging, crypto-strong state, inline UX feedback, and explicit runtime guards, eliminating the 504 timeout regressions.

## Change Overview

### Shared Platform Foundations

- `docs/02-APP-project-hardening/tasks/completed/shared-utilities-alignment.md`: Established `src/shared/{env,evm,api}.ts` plus image helpers that work in both browser and Edge contexts, backed by Vitest suites and updated build aliases.
- `docs/02-APP-project-hardening/tasks/completed/developer-experience-upgrades.md`: Introduced repository-wide lint/test commands (now served by Biome + Vitest) and refreshed contributor guidance so every surface imports the shared utilities consistently.

### Upload Pipeline

- `docs/02-APP-project-hardening/tasks/completed/upload-workflow-refactor.md`: Replaced the monolithic upload route with `useUploadForm` and focused presentation components (`TokenAssetCard`, `ChainAssetCard`, `PreviewPanel`, `ReviewDialog`), added cancellable ERC-20 lookups, and centralized preview generation in `src/lib/imagePreview.ts`.
- `docs/02-APP-project-hardening/tasks/completed/upload-api-hardening.md`: Rebuilt `app/api/upload.ts` around `_lib/upload` helpers, enforced PNG/EVM validation, unified GitHub PR creation for direct vs fork flows, and expanded test coverage for parsing and imaging utilities.

### Auth & OAuth Hardening

- `docs/02-APP-project-hardening/tasks/completed/auth-flow-hardening.md`: Delivered the `useGithubAuth` hook, React Query profile caching, crypto-grade state generation, and inline status messaging so the UI no longer blocks on modal dialogs.
- `docs/02-APP-project-hardening/tasks/completed/github-oauth-callback-debugging.md` & `docs/02-APP-project-hardening/tasks/completed/github-oauth-callback-remediation-notes.md`: Added structured diagnostics, base URL resolution guards, explicit redirect handling, and SPA rewrite fixes; documented the remediation timeline for historical context.
- `docs/02-APP-project-hardening/tasks/completed/edge-runtime-review.md`: Confirmed `callback.ts`, `erc20-name.ts`, and `upload.ts` operate cleanly on Edge, recommended explicit 302 responses, and validated the shared helpers for runtime parity.

### ERC-20 Name Service

- `docs/02-APP-project-hardening/tasks/completed/erc20-name-lookup.md`: Centralized ABI decoding + address validation in `src/shared/erc20.ts`, added configurable in-memory caching with structured error responses, and aligned client abort handling with the new API contract.

### Developer Tooling & Frontend Platform

- `biome.json` (root) and updated package scripts replace ESLint/Prettier with Biome, harmonizing lint + format commands across worktrees; see `docs/02-APP-project-hardening/tasks/completed/developer-experience-upgrades.md` for the rollout details.
- `docs/02-APP-project-hardening/tasks/completed/frontend-platform-upgrades.md`: Tracks the follow-on UX/tooling backlog (GitHub button loading state, upstream PR targeting); branch work closed out the Biome migration portion.

## Validation & Outstanding Actions

- Automated checks: `bun typecheck`, `bun lint` (Biome), `bun build`, and `bun run test`/`bun run validate` reported clean runs across tasks.
- Manual smoke tests still recommended (per task notes) for:
  - OAuth round-trip via `vercel dev` confirming cross-tab token sync (`auth-flow-hardening.md`).
  - Upload API with real assets to exercise GitHub PR emission and new error payloads (`upload-api-hardening.md`).
  - Upload UI flow ensuring FormData ordering and PR metadata match backend expectations (`upload-workflow-refactor.md`).
  - ERC-20 lookup cache hit/miss behavior and RPC fallback logging (`erc20-name-lookup.md`).

## Reviewer Guidance

- **Auth stack**: Validate `app/api/auth/github/callback.ts`, `src/hooks/useGithubAuth.ts`, and `src/components/GithubSignIn.tsx` for consistent state handling, logging guards, and inline UX updates.
- **Upload stack**: Review `src/features/upload/useUploadForm.ts`, `src/lib/imagePreview.ts`, and `app/api/_lib/upload.ts` together; confirm FormData keys align with API parsing and that previews revoke object URLs correctly.
- **Shared utilities**: Inspect `src/shared/{env,evm,erc20,api}.ts` plus associated tests to verify runtime-agnostic logic and env resolution fallbacks.
- **Tooling shift**: Check `biome.json`, updated package scripts, and any pre-commit hooks to understand the new lint/format expectations.
- **Documentation**: Cross-reference task write-ups under `docs/02-APP-project-hardening/tasks/completed/` for rationale, validation logs, and remaining follow-up items.

## Risk & Monitoring Notes

- Edge runtime deployments rely on Web-standard APIs; monitor Vercel logs for any oversized payloads that could stress the base64 fallbacks noted in `edge-runtime-review.md`.
- OAuth instrumentation emits detailed logs when `GITHUB_OAUTH_DEBUG` is enabledâ€”ensure the flag is tuned appropriately per environment to avoid noisy production logs.
- The upload cache sizes and ERC-20 lookup cache TTLs are configurable; review environment values post-merge to align with expected traffic patterns.
