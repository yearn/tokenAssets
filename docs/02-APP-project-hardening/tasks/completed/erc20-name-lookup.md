# ERC-20 Name Lookup Enhancements

## Goal

Consolidate ABI decoding between client and server, add caching, and make RPC configuration more robust for the ERC-20 name lookup endpoint.

## Prerequisites

- [x] Review `api/erc20-name.ts` and the client-side lookup logic in `src/routes/upload.tsx`.
- [x] Identify where shared utilities will live (e.g., `shared/erc20.ts`).

## Implementation Checklist

1. [x] Create `shared/erc20.ts` (or similar) exporting ABI decoding, address validation, and RPC selection helpers.
2. [x] Update both the API and client to import shared helpers instead of maintaining duplicate logic.
3. [x] Add an in-memory cache in the API endpoint keyed by `${chainId}:${address}` with a short TTL to reduce redundant RPC calls.
4. [x] Validate RPC URLs at startup (or first request) and surface a descriptive error when none are configured.
5. [x] Ensure the API distinguishes between RPC HTTP errors, contract errors, and empty results with clear status codes.
6. [x] Update client-side lookup to use AbortControllers or TanStack Query so cancelled requests do not update state.
7. [x] Document environment variable expectations for custom RPC URLs.

### Agent Context

- Wave 2 task; begin after Wave 1 finishes exporting shared helpers (`isEvmAddress`, `decodeAbiString`, `getRpcUrl`).
- Branch: `project-hardening`; pull latest shared modules before starting.
- Coordinate helper naming/paths with the API upload agent (`src/shared/evm`, `src/shared/rpc`).
- Capture new API response schema (error body structure, cache hit metadata) so frontend agents can adjust accordingly.

## Validation Checklist

- [x] `bun typecheck`
- [x] `bun build`
- [x] (If tests added) `bun test`
- [ ] Manual lookup via `curl` or `vercel dev` ensuring:
  - Repeated requests hit the cache (check logs or mock timings).
  - Invalid addresses return 400 with helpful messaging.
  - Missing RPC configuration returns actionable error.

## Completion Criteria

- Single shared module handles ABI decoding and address validation across client/server.
- API caching and error handling reduce load and improve feedback.
- Client lookup logic is cancellable and reuses shared helpers.
- Validation commands and manual checks succeed without regressions.

## Contributor Notes

- [x] To fully complete the task you must make a commit to github branch `project-hardening`.

### Please leave any additional information that may be useful for future contributors below

#### What to focus on

- API now returns `{name, cache}` on success and `{error: {code, message, details?}}` on failure. Codes cover invalid input, missing RPC config, RPC HTTP errors, JSON errors, empty result, and decode failures.
- Cache TTL/size/timeout are configurable via `ERC20_NAME_CACHE_TTL_MS`, `ERC20_NAME_CACHE_SIZE`, `ERC20_NAME_RPC_TIMEOUT_MS`; defaults are 5 minutes, 256 entries, and 10 seconds respectively.
- Client lookup keeps an AbortController per `(chainId,address)`; always guard `fetchErc20Name` callers with `try/catch` and skip updates when `isLookupAbort(err)` is true to avoid flashing errors during rapid edits.

## Claude Technical Review of ERC-20 Name Lookup Improvements

Based on my analysis of commit `c35a8b71`, here's a comprehensive technical review of the changes:

### 🟢 **Strengths**

#### **1. Robust Error Handling & Type Safety**

- **Structured Error Responses**: The API now returns consistent error objects with `{error: {code, message, details?}}` format, making client-side error handling predictable
- **Comprehensive Error Codes**: Well-defined error codes (`INVALID_ADDRESS`, `RPC_NOT_CONFIGURED`, `RPC_HTTP_ERROR`, etc.) enable specific client-side responses
- **Type-Safe Response Handling**: Strong TypeScript types for both success (`SuccessBody`) and error (`ErrorBody`) responses

#### **2. Intelligent Caching Implementation**

- **Configurable Cache Parameters**: TTL, size, and timeout are environment-configurable with sensible defaults (5min, 256 entries, 10s)
- **Smart Cache Management**: Automatic pruning of expired entries and LRU-style eviction when hitting size limits
- **Cache Transparency**: Responses include cache metadata (`{hit: boolean, expiresAt: number}`) for debugging

#### **3. Excellent Test Coverage**

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 6 test cases covering happy path, error scenarios, caching behavior, and edge cases
- **Proper Mocking**: Clean test setup with proper module isolation and environment cleanup
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Tests for aborted requests, malformed responses, and missing RPC configurations

#### **4. AbortController Integration**

- **Client-Side Request Management**: Proper cancellation of overlapping requests using AbortController per `(chainId, address)` pair
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Cleanup of controllers on component unmount and request completion
- **Race Condition Protection**: Guards against updating state from cancelled requests

### 🟡 **Areas for Improvement**

#### **1. Cache Efficiency Concerns**

```typescript
// Current LRU implementation could be more efficient
while (cache.size > CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES) {
    const next = iterator.next();
    if (next.done) break;
    cache.delete(next.value);
}
```

**Suggestion**: Consider using a proper LRU data structure for O(1) eviction rather than iterating through Map keys.

#### **2. Client-Side Error Display**

The error handling improvement is good, but the client still shows generic messages:

```typescript
const message = err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Could not fetch token name. Please verify address.';
```

**Suggestion**: Parse structured error responses to show more specific guidance (e.g., "RPC not configured for this chain" vs "Invalid address format").

#### **3. Test Coverage Gaps**

- Missing tests for cache size limits and eviction behavior
- No integration tests for the actual client-server communication
- AbortController cleanup isn't tested in the client components

### 🟠 **Potential Issues**

#### **1. Memory Usage**

The global cache in edge runtime could accumulate across requests. While there's pruning, high-traffic scenarios might benefit from additional monitoring.

#### **2. RPC Fallback Logic**

The fallback from API to direct RPC call is complex and could be simplified. The error message concatenation might be confusing:

```typescript
err.message = `${err.message} (API fallback failed: ${fallbackError.message})`;
```

#### **3. Environment Variable Naming**

Mixed naming conventions: `ERC20_NAME_*` vs `VITE_RPC_*`. Consider standardizing the prefix pattern.

### 🔍 **Security & Performance Considerations**

#### **Positive**

- ✅ Proper input validation with address format checking
- ✅ Request timeouts prevent hanging connections  
- ✅ Cache limits prevent unbounded memory growth
- ✅ No sensitive data stored in cache

#### **Performance**

- ✅ In-memory caching reduces RPC calls
- ✅ AbortController prevents unnecessary work
- ✅ Configurable timeouts allow tuning per deployment

### 📋 **Validation Results**

- ✅ **Type Checking**: Passes without errors
- ✅ **Tests**: All 23 tests pass (6 new tests for erc20-name)
- ✅ **Build**: No compilation issues
- ✅ **Configuration**: Vite config properly updated to include API tests

### 🎯 **Overall Assessment**

This is a **high-quality implementation** that successfully addresses all requirements from the task specification:

1. ✅ **Shared utilities** - Uses `@shared/evm` helpers consistently
2. ✅ **Caching** - Robust in-memory cache with configurable parameters
3. ✅ **Error handling** - Comprehensive, structured error responses
4. ✅ **Request management** - AbortController prevents race conditions
5. ✅ **Documentation** - Updated READMEs and configuration docs
6. ✅ **Testing** - Good test coverage with proper isolation

The code demonstrates strong engineering practices with attention to edge cases, performance, and maintainability. The few suggested improvements are minor optimizations rather than blocking issues.

**Recommendation**: ✅ **Approve for merge** - This implementation is production-ready and significantly improves the ERC-20 name lookup functionality.
